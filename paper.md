Paper title:
Towards Developing an Automated Faults Characterization Framework for Rotating Machines: Gear Faults
with Abaqus simulations

Abstract:
The feasibility and usefulness of frequency domain fusion of data from multiple vibration sensors installed on typical industrial rotating machines, based on coherent composite spectrum (CCS) as well as poly coherent composite spectrum (pCCS) techniques have been well-iterated by earlier studies. However, all previous endeavours been limited to rotor faults, thereby raising questions about the proficiency of the approach for classifying faults related to other critical rotating machines’ components such as gearboxes. Besides the restriction of scope of the founding CCS and pCCS studies to rotor-related faults, their diagnosis approach is manually implemented which could be unrealistic when faced with routine condition monitoring of multi-components industrial rotating machines, which often entails high frequency sampling at multiple locations. In order to alleviate these challenges, the preceding part of this paper introduced an automated framework that encompassed feature generation through CCS, data dimensionality reduction through principal components analysis (PCA) and faults classification using several machine learning techniques. The outcomes of the automated approach are a set of visualised decision maps representing individually simulated scenarios, which simplifies and minimises diagnosis-related downtime by allowing asset operators to easily identify anomalies at their incipient stages, without necessarily possessing vibration monitoring expertise. Therefore, building upon the encouraging results obtained from the preceding part of this approach that was limited to well-known rotor-related faults, this part of the paper now implements a similar approach on an entirely different and unique class of rotating machine component – the gearbox, so as to compliment earlier findings and ascertain robustness.

Introduction:
Since the rise of machines and consequently industrial revolutions, rotating machines have become an integral and inevitable asset within virtually all industrial setups, irrespective of the sector. This is mainly due to their versatility and ability to adapt to incredibly harsh operating environments that prevail in most industries. An industry that heavily relies on rotating machines for its sustainability is the energy industry. With the current surge for alternative energy and carbon footprints reduction, renewable energy sources such as wind and tidal energy are rapidly gaining attention and strides across the world.

Gearboxes are integral to the functioning of these emerging and alternative energy generation systems and are often envisaged to be robust enough to withstand highly dynamic operations. 

Simulations:
Zhifei Wu is working on the simulations section. 

Methodology:
It is vital to highlight that full details of automated faults classification framework applied here have been provided in the preceding article that focussed on rotor-related faults [47].

Results:
This thereby provides good encouragement that the approach may be suitable for integrating rotor and gearbox faults diagnosis into a single framework in the near future.

Conclusions:
Industrial rotating machines are multi-components assets which imply that a truly holistic faults classification framework should be capable of detecting anomalies associated with each component, since faults rarely occur in isolation.
