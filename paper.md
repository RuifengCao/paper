Paper title:
Towards Developing an Automated Faults Characterization Framework for Rotating Machines: Gear Faults
with Abaqus simulations

Introduction:
Since the rise of machines and consequently industrial revolutions, rotating machines have become an integral and inevitable asset within virtually all industrial setups, irrespective of the sector. This is mainly due to their versatility and ability to adapt to incredibly harsh operating environments that prevail in most industries. An industry that heavily relies on rotating machines for its sustainability is the energy industry. With the current surge for alternative energy and carbon footprints reduction, renewable energy sources such as wind and tidal energy are rapidly gaining attention and strides across the world.

Gray and Watson [2]

Gearboxes are integral to the functioning of these emerging and alternative energy generation systems and are often envisaged to be robust enough to withstand highly dynamic operations. 

Simulations:
Zhifei Wu is working on the simulations section. 

Methodology:
It is vital to highlight that full details of automated faults classification framework applied here have been provided in the preceding article that focussed on rotor-related faults [47].

Results:
This thereby provides good encouragement that the approach may be suitable for integrating rotor and gearbox faults diagnosis into a single framework in the near future.
