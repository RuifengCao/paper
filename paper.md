Paper title:
Towards Developing an Automated Faults Characterization Framework for Rotating Machines: Gear Faults

Introduction:
Since the rise of machines and consequently industrial revolutions, rotating machines have become an integral and inevitable asset within virtually all industrial setups, irrespective of the sector. This is mainly due to their versatility and ability to adapt to incredibly harsh operating environments that prevail in most industries. An industry that heavily relies on rotating machines for its sustainability is the energy industry. With the current surge for alternative energy and carbon footprints reduction, renewable energy sources such as wind and tidal energy are rapidly gaining attention and strides across the world.
